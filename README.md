# GeoFS-AUTO-BRK-LVL

A powerful Tampermonkey user script that adds **realistic auto brake functionality** to GeoFS. Ideal for airliners and some planes, the script streamlines your landing and rejected takeoff (RTO) procedures.

It ensures your **brakes** engage the moment your wheels touch the ground — provided you've armed them — while also supporting **manual braking** when auto brake is disarmed.

This is a separate version of https://github.com/Ahmd-Tint/GeoFS-SPLR-ARM-AUTO-BRK

## ✨ Features

| Feature | Shortcut | Activation | Description |
|---------|----------|------------|-------------|
| **Auto Brake** | <kbd>Ctrl</kbd> + <kbd>F11</kbd> | On Touchdown / RTO | Cycles through **RTO → DISARM → 1 → 2 → 3 → 4 → MAX**. Once armed, brakes are applied automatically based on mode: <br>- **RTO**: triggers if thrust is cut to idle above ~36 m/s, holds MAX braking until ~8 m/s.<br>- **1–MAX**: applies fixed braking levels.<br>- **DISARM**: brakes are fully manual; pilot input is respected. |

# GeoFS Real-World Autobrake Add-on

This add-on dynamically modifies the brake forces within GeoFS to simulate the authentic autobrake system behavior and strength of specific real-world commercial airliners.

---

## :airplane: Currently Supported Aircraft

The add-on automatically detects which aircraft you are flying and applies its corresponding IRL brake force settings and deceleration logic.
---
 * Boeing 737-700
 * Boeing 777-300ER
 * Airbus A350-900
 * Airbus A380-800
---
If you are using an unsupported aircraft model in GeoFS (e.g., Concorde), the add-on defaults to the settings of the Airbus A350-900. (Brake Strength)

## 🚀 Installation

This script requires **Tampermonkey**.

1. **Install Tampermonkey:** Get the extension for your browser.

   * [Tampermonkey for Chrome](https://www.tampermonkey.net/index.php?browser=chrome&locale=en)
   * [Tampermonkey for Edge](https://www.tampermonkey.net/index.php?browser=edge&locale=en)

2. **Install the Script:**

   * Click [**here**](https://github.com/Ahmd-Tint/GeoFS-AUTO-BRK-LVL/raw/main/main.user.js)
   * Tampermonkey will open a prompt to install the script.
   * Click **Install**.
   * Open GeoFS and enjoy!

## ⚙️ Usage Notes

- **RTO Mode:** Realistic rejected takeoff logic. Brakes **latch at MAX** until aircraft slows to ~1 m/s.
- **DISARM Mode:** Auto brakes are disabled. Pilot can brake ** manually without interference**.
- **Auto Brake Levels 1–MAX:** Apply predefined braking levels automatically on touchdown.

## Changelogs (for nerds only)

* V1: Initial Release (GeoFS is missing the features this addon includes, that's why it was made)
* V2.2 Added levels of braking. (Speedbird came up with this realistic idea!)
* V3.3: Instead of notifications, added the following. "RTO" changes depending on the current auto-brake mode. (Speedbird came up with this realistic idea!)
<img width="66" height="115" alt="image" src="https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/a67db3ac-cef9-41d7-baf7-601a3ded2ee2" />

* V4.3: The default brake force is now the B737-700 setting when an unsupported aircraft is used.
* V5.3: Fixed auto-brake RTO brake strength (after rejecting takeoff)
* V6.4:
  The Auto Brake system now uses unique, tuned brake force values for more aircraft.
  * **New Supported Aircraft:** Added custom brake profiles for:
    * **Boeing 777-300ER**
    * **Airbus A350-900**
    * **Airbus A380-800**
  * **Default Brake Force Update:** When flying an aircraft without a specific profile, the system will now default to using the brake force values of the ***Boeing 777-300ER***.
  * The RTO mode's issues have been improved.
